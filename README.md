1) How would you make an application testable, what do you do to ensure code quality?

A) Make sure code runs optimally and with the best possible solution. Come up with test cases that covers every possible scenario's. Apply best possible design patterns based on need and application requirement.

2) From a software development perspective, what steps might you take, on an ongoing basis, to continually improve your skillset? 

A) Learn new technilogies and practice daily so that those can be implemented when there is a need arises.

3) Provide an example of a time when you just couldn't complete all of your work on time to meet a deadline. What did you do? What was the result?

A) There was scenario in humana healthcare where there were multiple applications that needs to be migrated onto protegrity platform as there was deadline if we pass that then it would cause those applications to fail to meet all compliance requirement. I have got 5 applications that needs conversion and only able to 4 and 1 of them has dependencies with other team couldn't finish on time. So manager raised an exception to go into next release and was able to complete for next release but had to provide lot of documentation and explanation why the delay was.
